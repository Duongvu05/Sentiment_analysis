    "**Modern LLM Benchmark Comparison**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLaMA-3 8B Instruct was used as a benchmark to compare against the traditional methods on the same Twitter sentiment dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Results:**\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: 99.5% accuracy\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes**: 50.0% accuracy  \n",
    "- **LLaMA-3 8B**: 92.8% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods outperformed the modern LLM, which was unexpected given the LLM's massive parameter count and training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Traditional Methods Excelled:**\n",
    "1. **Perfect Feature Match**: Hand-crafted positive/negative word count features were ideally suited for this specific task\n",
    "2. **Clean Dataset**: The well-preprocessed Twitter dataset played to traditional methods' strengths\n",
    "3. **LLM Output Issues**: LLaMA-3 sometimes produced inconsistent responses that didn't fit the strict binary classification format\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Better context understanding, no manual feature engineering required, handles complex language patterns\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Massive computational overhead (20+ minutes vs seconds), inconsistent output format, resource intensive, black box interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison demonstrates that \"newer isn't always better\" in machine learning. The choice between approaches depends on specific requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traditional methods excel** when dealing with well-defined problems, limited resources, and need for fast, interpretable results\n",
    "- **LLMs shine** for complex language understanding tasks with abundant computational resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment highlights the continued relevance of fundamental ML techniques and the importance of good feature engineering, which can be as powerful as billions of parameters for specific tasks."
