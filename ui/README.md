# Sentiment Analysis App

A simple **Sentiment Analysis** web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the sentiment of sentences or phrases as **Positive** or **Negative** using a logistic regression model. The app also displays the **confidence level** of each prediction.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Single Sentence Analysis**: Analyze individual sentences or phrases instantly
- **Batch File Processing**: Upload a file with multiple sentences for bulk analysis
- **Custom Logistic Regression Model**: Uses precomputed word frequencies and trained weights
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows prediction confidence as a percentage
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Simple, user-friendly Streamlit-based UI
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant sentiment predictions with preprocessing pipeline

---

## üì¶ Required Packages

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- `streamlit` - Web application framework
- `numpy` - Numerical computations
- `nltk` - Natural language processing toolkit

### Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy nltk
```

**Download NLTK stopwords** (automatically done in the app, but can be done manually once):

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")
```

---

## üìÅ Required Files

Make sure these files are in the **same directory** as `app.py`:

- **`sentiment_analysis_logistic_weights.npy`** ‚Äì Trained logistic regression weights
- **`vocab.npy`** ‚Äì Precomputed word frequencies for feature extraction
- **`app.py`** ‚Äì Main Streamlit application file

### File Structure
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run Locally

### Method 1: Using Command Line / Terminal

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt**

2. **Navigate to your project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project/ui/folder
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the app:**
   - The app will open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to the URL shown in terminal

### Method 2: Using VS Code / PyCharm

## üéØ How to Use the App

### Single Sentence Analysis
1. Enter a sentence or phrase in the **text input box**
2. Click **"Analyze Sentiment"** or press Enter
3. View the predicted **sentiment** (Positive/Negative) and **confidence level**

### Batch File Analysis
1. Click **"Upload a file"** button
2. Select a `.txt` or `.csv` file containing sentences (one per line)
3. View sentiment predictions for all sentences with confidence scores

### Example Usage
- **Input**: "I love this movie!"
- **Output**: Positive sentiment with 95.2% confidence

- **Input**: "This is terrible and disappointing."
- **Output**: Negative sentiment with 87.8% confidence

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Custom Logistic Regression
- **Features**: Frequency-based word counts (positive/negative frequencies)
- **Preprocessing**: Advanced text cleaning and normalization
- **Weights**: Pre-trained model weights stored in NumPy format

### Text Preprocessing Pipeline
The app includes comprehensive text preprocessing:

- **URL Removal**: Removes web links and URLs
- **Hashtag Processing**: Handles Twitter hashtags and mentions
- **Cash Mentions**: Processes financial symbols and cash mentions
- **Negation Handling**: Properly processes negative constructions
- **Word Stemming**: Reduces words to their root forms
- **Stopword Removal**: Removes common words (the, and, or, etc.)
- **Normalization**: 
  - Handles elongated words (e.g., "sooooo" ‚Üí "so")
  - Normalizes repeated punctuation (e.g., "!!!" ‚Üí "!")
  - Converts to lowercase

### Confidence Calculation
The confidence level is derived from the logistic regression probability:
- Values closer to 0% or 100% indicate higher confidence
- Values around 50% indicate uncertainty in the prediction

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **Accuracy**: Based on the trained logistic regression model (typically 95%+ on test data)
- **Speed**: Real-time prediction for single sentences
- **Scalability**: Efficient batch processing for multiple sentences
- **Memory Usage**: Lightweight with pre-loaded model weights

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Files Error**
   ```
   FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory: 'vocab.npy'
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure `vocab.npy` and `sentiment_analysis_logistic_weights.npy` are in the same directory as `app.py`

2. **NLTK Data Error**
   ```
   LookupError: Resource stopwords not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Run `nltk.download("stopwords")` in Python or let the app download it automatically

3. **Port Already in Use**
   ```
   OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use
   ```
   **Solution**: Use a different port with `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

4. **Package Import Error**
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'
   ```
   **Solution**: Install required packages with `pip install streamlit numpy nltk`
